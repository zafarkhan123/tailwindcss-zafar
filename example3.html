        <h1> CSS and Flex Card</h1>
        <p>This book takes a completely different approach. I won't teach you the things flex and grid can do. Instead, I will first show you some components and layouts and make you think how to build them using the CSS concepts you already know. Now you have a problem, and you want a solution.</p>
